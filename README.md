# Python-testing-pytest

In this exercise, you will be using [pytest](https://pytest.org) for testing. Add the `squared()`
function in `src/app.py`. Then create the tests inside of `src/test_app.py` so that they do what
their name explains they do. Run *pytest* by executing `pytest` inside the `src/` directory.
